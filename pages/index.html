                    Hi! my name is Ian Viveiros. I am a 22-year-old computer science graduate student from Reading, Pennsylvania. I graduated from
                    York College of Pennsylvania in December 2023 and am currently studying at Georgia Institute of Technology.

                <p class="about-me" id="about-me-p2">
                    I have always been fascinated by technology and played a lot of video games growing up. Because of this, when I was in middle
                    school, my parents bought me a Minecraft modding course that taught me the basics of Java and how to navigate and use the
                    Eclipse IDE. Once I got to high school, I did a science fair project involving statistical modeling in Python. The intent of
                    this project was to analyze pitches across several baseball games to see if the model could accurately predict the next throw.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Despite these prior experiences, I didn't actually do much programming until I got to college. I entered York College of
                    Pennsylvania in Fall 2020 as a computer engineering major. However, after completing 4 semesters of computer engineering
                    coursework and one hardware-based engineering internship, I decided to switch my major to computer science since I much
                    prefer programming as opposed to working with electrical or computer hardware.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It wasn't until my sophomore year that I found my passion for programming. Once I had developed the skills needed to create
                    my own projects, software development actually became a hobby of mine rather than something I felt like I needed to do to
                    look good on a resume. Since then, I have worked on several projects including Minecraft mods, a Pok√©mon Platinum bot, a
                    radio telescope, a card game repository, and several more.
