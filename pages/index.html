                    Hi! my name is Ian Viveiros. I am a 22-year-old computer science graduate student from Reading, Pennsylvania. I graduated from
                    York College of Pennsylvania in December 2023 and am currently studying at Georgia Institute of Technology.

                    I have always been fascinated by technology and played a lot of video games growing up. Because of this, when I was in middle
                    school, my parents bought me a Minecraft modding course that taught me the basics of Java and how to navigate and use the
                    Eclipse IDE. Once I got to high school, I did a science fair project involving statistical modeling in Python. The intent of
                    this project was to analyze pitches across several baseball games to see if the model could accurately predict the next throw.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Despite these prior experiences, I didn't actually do much programming until I got to college. I entered York College of
                    Pennsylvania in Fall 2020 as a computer engineering major. However, after completing 4 semesters of computer engineering
                    coursework and one hardware-based engineering internship, I decided to switch my major to computer science since I much
                    prefer programming as opposed to working with electrical or computer hardware.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It wasn't until my sophomore year that I found my passion for programming. Once I had developed the skills needed to create
                    my own projects, software development actually became a hobby of mine rather than something I felt like I needed to do to
                    look good on a resume. Since then, I have worked on several projects including Minecraft mods, a Pok√©mon Platinum bot, a
                    radio telescope, and a card game repository.

                    Since I began my computer science studies, I have completed two internships and have worked as a part-time software
                    developer. My first internship mainly involved working with PLCs, control panels, and circuit diagrams while my
                    second internship mainly focused on front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. During my time as a part-time
                    software developer, I became very familiar with using the Android Studio IDE to make modifications to an Android
                    application that was mainly written in Java and XML.

                    <br>
                    In addition to my work experience, I also have a lot of project experience. During my time at school, I got the opportunity
                    to work on two different capstone projects: a <a href="https://github.com/YCPRadioTelescope">radio telescope</a> and a
                    <a href="https://github.com/YCP-Rev-Metrix">mobile application</a> intended to help bowlers improve their overall
                    performance by tracking statistics and giving feedback on throws. In addition to these projects, I also got the opportunity
                    to work with some friends on a <a href="https://github.com/ianvivi13/GameRepo">card game repository</a> in our software
                    design class.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I have also worked extensively on personal projects. I have been consistently working on Minecraft modding since Summer 2022,
                    both with a friend and on my own. Additionally, some of my other projects have been great learning experiences for me,
                    giving me the opportunity to learn new languages, technologies, or concepts relating to the field.

                    In my free time, one of my favorite things to do is play games. One of the main reasons I was originally interested in
                    computer science was the idea of developing my own game. Although this has not happened yet, I do intend on learning
                    how to create a game completely from scratch sometime in the near future. When I'm not playing games, I enjoy programming,
                    riding my electric unicycle, watching YouTube or TV, and spending time with friends and family.
